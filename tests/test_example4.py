"""Unit tests 19-22: the 3x2pt likelihood on the frozen DES-Y1 data.

3x2pt combines three two-point correlations: cosmic shear, galaxy
clustering, and galaxy-galaxy lensing; here it is the
des_y3.combo_3x2pt likelihood evaluated on the frozen copy of
example4's configuration: the same likelihood class as tests 5-8,
pointed at the DES-Y1 data (des_y1_real.dataset, with its own data
vector, covariance, masks, and n(z) tables) instead of the DES-Y3
data (see cocoa_test_utils for what "frozen" means and for the Y1/Y3
split). The four tests:

 19. chi2 at the frozen fiducial point, within CHI2_TOLERANCE (0.2) of
     the frozen reference value.
 20. race check: on one model, the fiducial evaluated fresh and again
     as the 10th of 10 cosmologies in a row must agree to
     RACE_TOLERANCE (1e-4). A disagreement means state leaked between
     evaluations or OpenMP threads raced.
 21. the same comparison as test 19 with the TATT intrinsic-alignment
     model (IA_model: 1) and DES_A2_1 = 0.05, DES_BTA_1 = 0.05,
     DES_A2_2 = -1.51541 replacing the NLA point's zeros.
 22. the same race check as test 20 with the TATT model.

To run (from the Cocoa/ folder, cocoa environment active,
start_cocoa.sh sourced):
